description: Getting started with GenSX

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to get up and running with GenSX. GenSX is a simple typescript framework for building complex LLM applications using JSX. If you haven't already, check out the [basic concepts](../basic-concepts) to learn more about how GenSX works.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 20 or higher installed
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) with access to the required models
- A package manager of your choice ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))

## Create a new project

To get started, run the following command with your package manager of choice in an empty directory. This will create a new GenSX project to get you started.

```bash
# Using npm
npm create gensx@latest my-app

# Using npx
npx create-gensx@latest my-app

# Using yarn
yarn create gensx my-app

# Using pnpm
pnpm create gensx my-app
```

In `index.tsx`, you'll find a simple OpenAI chat completion component:

```tsx
import { gsx } from "gensx";
import { OpenAIProvider, ChatCompletion } from "@gensx/openai";

interface RespondProps {
  userInput: string;
}
type RespondOutput = string;

const Respond = gsx.Component<RespondProps, RespondOutput>(
  "Respond",
  async ({ userInput }) => {
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          {
            role: "system",
            content:
              "You are a helpful assistant. Respond to the user's input.",
          },
          { role: "user", content: userInput },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);

const result = await gsx.execute<string>(
  <OpenAIProvider apiKey={process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}>
    <Respond userInput="Hi there! Say 'Hello, World!' and nothing else." />
  </OpenAIProvider>,
);

console.log(result);
```

The component is executed through `gsx.execute()`, which processes the JSX tree from top to bottom. In this example:

1. First, the `OpenAIProvider` component is initialized with your API key
2. Then, the `Respond` component receives the `userInput` prop
3. Inside `Respond`, a `ChatCompletion` component is created with the specified model and messages
4. The result flows back up through the tree, ultimately returning the response from gpt-4o-mini.

Components in GenSX are pure functions that take props and return outputs, making them easy to test and compose. The JSX structure makes the data flow clear and explicit - each component's output can be used by its children through standard TypeScript/JavaScript.

### Running the project

To run the project, you'll need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
# Set the environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Run the project
pnpm dev
```

## Combining components

The example above is a simple workflow with a single component. In practice, you'll often want to combine multiple components to create more complex workflows.

Components can be nested to create multi-step workflows with each component's output being passed through a child function. For example, let's define two components: a `Research` component that gathers information about a topic, and a `Writer` component that uses that information to write a blog post.

```tsx
// Research component that gathers information
const Research = gsx.Component<{ topic: string }, string>(
  "Research",
  async ({ topic }) => {
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          {
            role: "system",
            content:
              "You are a research assistant. Provide key facts about the topic.",
          },
          { role: "user", content: topic },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);

// Writer component that uses research to write content
const Writer = gsx.Component<{ topic: string; research: string }, string>(
  "Writer",
  async ({ topic, research }) => {
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          {
            role: "system",
            content:
              "You are a content writer. Use the research provided to write a blog post about the topic.",
          },
          { role: "user", content: `Topic: ${topic}\nResearch: ${research}` },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);
```

Now you can combine these components using a child function:

```tsx
// Combine components using child functions
const result = await gsx.execute<string>(
  <OpenAIProvider apiKey={process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}>
    <Research topic="quantum computing">
      {(research) => <Writer topic="quantum computing" research={research} />}
    </Research>
  </OpenAIProvider>,
);

console.log(result);
```

In this example, the `Research` component gathers information about the topic which then passes the informaton to the `Writer` component. The `Writer` component uses that information to write an article about the topic which is then returned as the `result`.

### Streaming

One common challenge with LLM workflows is handling streaming responses. Any given LLM call can return a response as a string or as a stream of tokens. Typically you'll want the last component of your workflow to stream the response.

To take advantage of streaming, all you need to do is update the `Writer` component to use `StreamComponent` and pass `stream={true}` when you invoke it.

```tsx
const Writer = gsx.StreamComponent<{ topic: string; research: string }, string>(
  "Writer",
  async ({ topic, research }) => {
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        stream={true}
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          {
            role: "system",
            content:
              "You are a content writer. Use the research provided to write a blog post about the topic.",
          },
          { role: "user", content: `Topic: ${topic}\nResearch: ${research}` },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);

const stream = await gsx.execute<Streamable>(
  <OpenAIProvider apiKey={process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}>
    <Research topic="quantum computing">
      {(research) => (
        <Writer topic="quantum computing" research={research} stream={true} />
      )}
    </Research>
  </OpenAIProvider>,
);

// Print the streaming response
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

While this is nice, the real power of streaming components comes when you expand or refactor your workflow. Now you could easily add an `<Editor>` component to the workflow that streams the response to the user with minimal changes. There's no extra plumbing needed besides removing the `stream={true}` prop on the `Writer` component.

```tsx
const stream = await gsx.execute<Streamable>(
  <OpenAIProvider apiKey={process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}>
    <Research topic="quantum computing">
      {(research) => <Writer topic="quantum computing" research={research}>
        {(content) => <Editor content={content} stream={true}/>}
      </Writer>
    </Research>
  </OpenAIProvider>,
```
