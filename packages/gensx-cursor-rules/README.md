This package provides cursor rules for GenSX projects.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @gensx/cursor-rules
```

or

## Usage

The cursor rules are automatically installed into your project's `.cursor` directory during the `postinstall` script. You don't need to do anything manually.

## What are cursor rules?

Cursor rules provide documentation and code snippets for GenSX components, which can be surfaced by IDEs and development tools that integrate with [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/).

These rules help with:

- Providing accurate code examples for GenSX components
- Showing proper parameter usage for LLM providers
- Enabling proper code completion for GenSX workflows

## Included Rules

- `gensx.mdc` - Core GenSX concepts and syntax

- `gensx-ai-sdk.mdc` - Vercel AI SDK integration

## Custom rules

You can add your own custom rules by creating additional `.mdc` files in your project's `.cursor` directory. Your custom rules will be preserved when updating this package.
