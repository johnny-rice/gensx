[GenSX](https://gensx.dev/) is a simple typescript framework for building complex LLM applications. It's built around functional, reusable components that are composed to create and orchestrate workflows.

Designed for backend development, GenSX makes it easy to build and test powerful LLM workflows that can be turned into REST APIs or integrated into existing applications.

## Why GenSX?

- 🎯 **Pure Functions**: Components are pure TypeScript functions that are easily testable, reusable, and sharable
- 🌴 **Natural Composition**: Chain LLM calls using JSX - a familiar, visual syntax that reads top-to-bottom like normal code
- ⚡️ **Parallel by Default**: Components execute in parallel when possible while maintaining dependencies
- 🔒 **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with no DSLs or special syntax - just standard language features
- 🌊 **Streaming Built-in**: Stream responses with a single prop change, no refactoring needed
- 🚀 **Built for Scale**: Start simple and evolve to complex patterns like agents and reflection without changing your programming model

Check out the [documentation](https://gensx.dev/overview) to learn more about building LLM applications with GenSX.

## Getting Started

To create a new GenSX project, run the following command:

```bash
npm create gensx@latest my-app
```

To add GenSX to an existing project, run the following command and follow the instructions described [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gensx):

```bash
npm install gensx @gensx/openai
```

Check out the [Quickstart Guide](https://gensx.dev/quickstart) for more details on getting started.

## Building a workflow, the declarative way!

Most LLM frameworks are graph oriented--you express your workflow with nodes, edges, and a global state object. GenSX takes a different approach--you compose your workflow with components, and GenSX handles the execution for you.

You start by defining your components:

```tsx
import { gsx } from "gensx";
import { OpenAIProvider, ChatCompletion } from "@gensx/openai";

// Define the input props and output type for type safety
interface CreateOutlineProps {
  prompt: string;
}
type CreateOutlineOutput = string;

// Create a reusable component that can be composed with others
const CreateOutline = gsx.Component<CreateOutlineProps, CreateOutlineOutput>(
  "CreateOutline",
  async ({ prompt }) => {
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          {
            role: "user",
            content: `Create an outline for an article about ${prompt}`,
          },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);

interface WriteArticleProps {
  outline: string;
}
type WriteArticleOutput = string;

const WriteArticle = gsx.Component<WriteArticleProps, WriteArticleOutput>(
  "WriteArticle",
  async ({ outline }) => {
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          {
            role: "user",
            content: `Use this outline to write a detailed article: ${outline}`,
          },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);
```

Then you can compose your components together to create a workflow:

```tsx
// Execute the workflow with the OpenAI provider
const result = await gsx.execute<string>(
  <OpenAIProvider apiKey={process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}>
    <CreateOutline prompt="the future of LLM dev tools">
      {(outline) => <WriteArticle outline={outline} />}
    </CreateOutline>
  </OpenAIProvider>,
);

console.log(result);
```
