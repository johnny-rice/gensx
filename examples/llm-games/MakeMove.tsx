Tic Tac Toe rules:
- The board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their pieces on the board.
- You can only place your piece in an empty square.
- You win if you can get 3 of your pieces in a row, column, or diagonal.
- The game is a draw if the board is full and no player has won.

You will be sent the board. You will respond with JSON in following format, that represents where you want to place your piece.

   "column": 1|2|3

Before you make your move, talk through your strategy and figure out the best move to make. Then respond with the json inside of <move> xml tags (no backticks).`;
