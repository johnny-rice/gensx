## Description

This command:

1. Builds your workflow
2. Uploads it to GenSX Cloud
3. Creates or updates the deployment
4. Sets up any environment variables specified

After successful deployment, your workflow will be available for remote execution via the [GenSX Cloud console](https://app.gensx.com) or through the `gensx run` command.

## Examples

```bash
# Deploy a workflow
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts

# Deploy to a specific project and environment
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts --project my-production-project --env dev

# Deploy with environment variables
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts -e API_KEY=abc123 -e DEBUG=true

# Deploy with an environment variable taken from your local environment
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts -e OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Notes

- You must be logged in to GenSX Cloud to deploy (`gensx login`)
- `gensx deploy` requires Docker to be running
- If your workflow requires API keys or other secrets, provide them using the `-e` or `--env-var` option
- For environment variables without a specified value, the CLI will use the value from your local environment
- After deployment, you can manage your workflows from the GenSX Cloud console
- The deployment process automatically handles bundling dependencies
