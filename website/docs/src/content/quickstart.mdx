# Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to get up and running with GenSX, a simple typescript framework for building complex LLM applications.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 20 or higher installed
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- A package manager of your choice ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))

## Install the `gensx` CLI

You can install the `gensx` CLI using your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm i -g gensx
```

Alternatively, if you prefer not to install the CLI globally, you can prefix every command in this guide with `npx`.

## Log in to GenSX Cloud (optional)

If you want to be able to visualize your workflows and view traces, you'll need to log in to GenSX Cloud. This is optional, but recommended.

![example trace](/quickstart/trace-rag.png)

To log in into GenSX Cloud, run the following command:

```bash
gensx login
```

You'll be redirected to the GenSX website and will need to create an account if you don't have one already.

Once you're logged in, you're ready to create a workflow! Workflow traces will automatically be saved to the cloud so you can visualize and debug workflow executions.

## Create a new project

To get started, run the `new` command with a project name of your choice. This will create a new GenSX project with a simple workflow to get you started.

```bash
gensx new <project-name>
```

When creating a new project, you'll be prompted to select IDE rules to add to your project. These rules help AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, Cline, and Windsurf understand your GenSX project better, providing more accurate code suggestions and help.

In `src/workflows.ts`, you'll find a simple `Chat` component and workflow:

```ts
import * as gensx from "@gensx/core";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { generateText } from "@gensx/vercel-ai";

interface ChatProps {
  userMessage: string;
}

const Chat = gensx.Component("Chat", async ({ userMessage }: ChatProps) => {
  const result = await generateText({
    model: openai("gpt-4.1-mini"),
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
      },
      { role: "user", content: userMessage },
    ],
  });
  return result.text;
});

const ChatWorkflow = gensx.Workflow(
  "ChatWorkflow",
  async ({ userMessage }: ChatProps) => {
    return await Chat({ userMessage });
  },
);

export { ChatWorkflow };
```

This template shows the basics of building a GenSX workflow:

- Components and workflows are just pure functions that take inputs and return outputs
- You create components and workflows by calling `gensx.Component()` and `gensx.Workflow()` along with a name and a function.
- Components are the building blocks of workflows. Workflows are the entry point to your application and are what we'll deploy as an API in a few steps.
- You can use the LLM package of your choice. GenSX provides `@gensx/vercel-ai`, `@gensx/openai`, and `@gensx/anthropic` out of the box. These packages are simply wrappers around the original packages optimized for GenSX.

### Running the workflow

The project template includes a `src/index.ts` file that you can use to run the workflow:

```ts
import { ChatWorkflow } from "./workflows.js";

const result = await ChatWorkflow({
  userMessage: "Hi there! Say 'Hello, World!' and nothing else.",
});

console.log(result);
```

There's nothing special here--workflows are just invoked like any other function.
To run the workflow, you'll need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
# Set the environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

# Run the project
pnpm dev
```

This will run the workflow and print the workflow's output to the console along with a URL to the trace (if you're logged in).

```bash
[GenSX] View execution at: https://app.gensx.com/<org>/<project>/executions/<run-id>?workflowName=ChatWorkflow

Hello, World!
```

You can now view the trace for this run in GenSX Cloud by clicking the link:

![trace](/quickstart/trace.png)

The trace shows a flame graph of your workflow, including every component that executed with inputs and outputs.

Some components will be hidden by default, but you can click the carat to expand them. Clicking on a component will show you details about it's inputs and outputs.

For longer running workflows, this view will update in real time as the workflow executes.

## Running the dev server

Now that you've built your first workflow, you can easily turn it into a REST API.

GenSX provides a local development server with local REST APIs that match the shape of workflows deployed to GenSX Cloud. You can run the dev server from the CLI:

```bash
# Start the development server
gensx start src/workflows.ts
```

The development server provides several key features:

- **Hot reloading**: Changes to your code are automatically detected and recompiled
- **API endpoints**: Each workflow is exposed as a REST endpoint
- **Swagger UI**: Interactive documentation for your workflows at `http://localhost:1337/swagger-ui`
- **Local storage**: Built-in support for blob storage and databases

You'll see something like this when you start the server:

```bash
🚀 GenSX Dev Server running at http://localhost:1337
🧪 Swagger UI available at http://localhost:1337/swagger-ui

Available workflows:
- ChatWorkflow: http://localhost:1337/workflows/ChatWorkflow

Listening for changes... 10:58:55 AM
```

You can now test your workflow by sending requests to the provided URL using any HTTP client, or using the built-in Swagger UI at `http://localhost:1337/swagger-ui`.

## Deploying your project to GenSX Cloud

Now that you've tested your APIs locally, you can deploy them to the cloud. GenSX Cloud provides serverless deployment with zero configuration:

```bash
# Deploy your project to GenSX Cloud
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts -e OPENAI_API_KEY
```

This command:

1. Builds your TypeScript code for production
2. Bundles all dependencies
3. Uploads the package to GenSX Cloud
4. Creates REST API endpoints for each workflow
5. Configures serverless infrastructure

For production deployments, you can target a specific environment:

```bash
# Deploy to production environment
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts -e OPENAI_API_KEY --env production
```

### Running a workflow from the CLI

Once deployed, you can execute your workflows directly from the command line:

```bash
# Run a workflow synchronously
gensx run ChatWorkflow --input '{"userMessage":"Write a poem about an AI loving raccoon"}'

# Save the output to a file
gensx run ChatWorkflow --input '{"userMessage":"Write a haiku"}' --output result.json
```

The CLI makes it easy to test your workflows and integrate them into scripts or automation.

### Running a workflow from the GenSX console

The GenSX Cloud console provides a visual interface for managing and executing your workflows:

1. Log in to [app.gensx.com](https://app.gensx.com)
2. Navigate to your project and environment
3. Select the workflow you want to run
4. Click the "Run" button and enter your input
5. View the results directly in the console

![Running a workflow in the console](/quickstart/run-console.png)

The console also provides API documentation and code snippets for your workflows as well as execution history and tracing for all previous workflow runs.

## Improving your workflow with storage

Now that you've deployed your first workflow, you can use GenSX's cloud storage to build more sophisticated workflows. GenSX offers three types of builtin storage: blob storage, sql database storage and, full text and vector search storage.

In this section, we'll add chat history using blob storage and then add in RAG using vector search.

### Chat history with blob storage

To start, we'll add chat history to our workflow. First, we need to install the `@gensx/storage` package then import the `useBlob` hook.

```bash
npm install @gensx/storage
```

```ts
import { useBlob } from "@gensx/storage";
```

Next, we need to update the interfaces for our workflow.

```ts
interface ChatProps {
  userMessage: string;
  threadId: string; // add thread id for tracking the history
}

// Add this interface for storing chat history
interface ChatMessage {
  role: "system" | "user" | "assistant";
  content: string;
}
```

Now, we're ready to update the `Chat` component to use blob storage to store chat history.

```ts
const Chat = gensx.Component(
  "Chat",
  async ({ userMessage, threadId }: ChatProps) => {
    // Function to load chat history
    const loadChatHistory = async (): Promise<ChatMessage[]> => {
      const blob = useBlob<ChatMessage[]>(`chat-history/${threadId}.json`);
      const history = await blob.getJSON();
      return history ?? [];
    };

    // Function to save chat history
    const saveChatHistory = async (messages: ChatMessage[]): Promise<void> => {
      const blob = useBlob<ChatMessage[]>(`chat-history/${threadId}.json`);
      await blob.putJSON(messages);
    };

    try {
      // Load existing chat history
      const existingMessages = await loadChatHistory();

      // Add the new user message
      const updatedMessages = [
        ...existingMessages,
        { role: "user", content: userMessage } as ChatMessage,
      ];

      // Generate response using the model
      const result = await generateText({
        messages: updatedMessages,
        model: openai("gpt-4.1-mini"),
      });

      // Add the assistant's response to the history
      const finalMessages = [
        ...updatedMessages,
        { role: "assistant", content: result.text } as ChatMessage,
      ];

      // Save the updated chat history
      await saveChatHistory(finalMessages);

      console.log(
        `[Thread ${threadId}] Chat history updated with new messages`,
      );

      return result.text;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in chat processing:", error);
      return `Error processing your request in thread ${threadId}. Please try again.`;
    }
  },
);

const ChatWorkflow = gensx.Workflow(
  "ChatWorkflow",
  async ({ userMessage, threadId }: ChatProps) => {
    return await Chat({ userMessage, threadId });
  }
);
```

When run locally, GenSX blob storage will just write to the local filesystem and when you deploy the workflow it will automatically start using cloud storage.

After you've made these updates, deploy and run the workflow again to see chat history in action.

```bash
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts -e OPENAI_API_KEY

# send an initial message to the thead
gensx run ChatWorkflow --input '{"userMessage":"Name the capital of France", "threadId":"123"}'

# use the same thread
gensx run ChatWorkflow --input '{"userMessage":"What was my previous message?", "threadId":"123"}'

```

You should see that the model remembers the previous message. You can also go to the *Blob Storage* tab in the [GenSX Cloud console](https://app.gensx.com) and see the blob that was created.

### Add RAG with vector search

Next, let's add RAG to our workflow. We'll use GenSX's [llms-full.txt](https://www.gensx.com/llms-full.txt) file and store it in GenSX's vector search.

First, we need to build a workflow that will populate the vector search namespace. Add this to your workflows.ts file.

```ts
import { useSearch } from "@gensx/storage";
import { embedMany } from "@gensx/vercel-ai";

export const InitializeSearch = gensx.Workflow("InitializeSearch", async () => {
  // useSearch will create the namespace automatically if it doesn't exist.
  const namespace = await useSearch("gensx-docs");

  // Fetch content from the URL
  const content = await (
    await fetch("https://www.gensx.com/llms-full.txt")
  ).text();

  // Split content on H1 headings and filter out empty sections
  const documents = content
    .split(/\n# /)
    .map((text, i) => ({ id: `section-${i + 1}`, text: text.trim() }))
    .filter((doc) => doc.text.length > 0);

  // Create embeddings for the documents
  const embeddings = await embedMany({
    model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
    values: documents.map((doc) => doc.text),
  });

  // Write the documents to the vector search namespace
  await namespace.write({
    upsertRows: documents.map((doc, index) => ({
      id: doc.id,
      vector: embeddings.embeddings[index],
      text: doc.text,
    })),
    distanceMetric: "cosine_distance",
  });

  return `Search namespace initialized`;
});
```

Next, let's add a tool that will use the vector search namespace to answer questions.

```ts
import { useSearch } from "@gensx/storage";
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { embed } from "@gensx/vercel-ai";

const tools = {
  search: tool({
  description: "Search the GenSX documentation",
  parameters: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe("the search query"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ query }: { query: string }) => {
    const namespace = await useSearch("gensx-docs");

    const { embedding } = await embed({
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      value: query,
    });

    // Search for similar documents
    const results = await namespace.query({
      vector: embedding,
      topK: 5,
      includeAttributes: true,
    });

    return results;
  },
  }),
};
```

Finally, update the `Chat` component to use the new tool. You also need to set `maxSteps` to allow the sdk to process the tool calls.

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  messages: updatedMessages,
  model: openai("gpt-4.1-mini"),
  tools,
  maxSteps: 5,
});
```

Great! Now you're ready to deploy the workflows and test them:

```bash
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts -e OPENAI_API_KEY

# initialize the search namespace
gensx run InitializeSearch

# run the workflow
gensx run ChatWorkflow --input '{"userMessage":"Succinctly describe GenSX", "threadId":"789"}'
```

Now when you go look at the trace, you'll see that the model used the tool call to search the GenSX documentation. The trace allows you to see all the inputs and outputs of each component including the inputs and outputs of the tool call.
