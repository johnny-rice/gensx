# Local development server

GenSX provides local development experience that mirrors the cloud environment, making it easy to build and test workflows on your machine before deploying them.

## Starting the dev server

The `gensx start` command launches a local development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
gensx start ./src/workflows.ts
```

```bash
🔍 Starting GenSX Dev Server...
ℹ Starting development server...

🚀 GenSX Dev Server running at http://localhost:1337
🧪 Swagger UI available at http://localhost:1337/swagger-ui

📋 Available workflows:
- RAGWorkflow: http://localhost:1337/workflows/RAGWorkflow
- AnalyzeDiscordWorkflow: http://localhost:1337/workflows/AnalyzeDiscordWorkflow
- TextToSQLWorkflow: http://localhost:1337/workflows/TextToSQLWorkflow
- ChatAgent: http://localhost:1337/workflows/ChatAgent

✅ Server is running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

## Development server features

### Identical API shape

The local API endpoints match exactly what you'll get in production, making it easy to test your workflows before deploying them. The only difference is that the `/org/{org}/project/{project}/environments/{env}` path is left out of the url for simplicity.

```
http://localhost:1337/workflows/{workflow}
```

Every workflow you export is automatically available as an API endpoint.

### Hot reloading

The development server watches your TypeScript files and automatically:

1. Recompiles when files change
2. Regenerates API schemas
3. Restarts the server with your updated code

This enables a fast development cycle without manual restarts.

### API documentation

The development server includes a built-in Swagger UI for exploring and testing your workflows:

```
http://localhost:1337/swagger-ui
```

![Swagger UI for local development](/cloud/local-swagger-ui.png)

The Swagger interface provides:

- Complete documentation of all your workflow APIs
- Interactive testing
- Request/response examples
- Schema information

## Running workflows locally

### Using the API

You can use any HTTP client to interact with your local API:

```bash
# Run a workflow synchronously
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/workflows/ChatAgent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Tell me about GenSX"}}'

# Run asynchronously

curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/workflows/ChatAgent/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Tell me about GenSX"}}'
```

The inputs and outputs of the APIs match exactly what you'll encounter in production.

### Using the Swagger UI

The built-in Swagger UI provides an easy way to inspect and test your workflows:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:1337/swagger-ui`
2. Select the workflow you want to test
3. Click the "Try it out" button
4. Enter your input data
5. Execute the request and view the response

## Local storage options

GenSX provides local implementations for cloud storage services, enabling you to develop and test stateful workflows without deploying to the cloud.

### Blob storage

When using `useBlob` in local development, data is stored in your local filesystem:

```ts
import { useBlob } from "@gensx/storage";

const StoreData = gensx.Component(
  "StoreData",
  async ({ key, data }: StoreDataInput) => {
    // Locally, this will write to .gensx/blobs directory
    const blob = useBlob(`data/${key}.json`);
    await blob.putJSON(data);
    return { success: true };
  },
);
```

Files are stored in the `.gensx/blobs` directory in your project, making it easy to inspect the stored data.

### SQL databases

When using `useDatabase` locally, GenSX uses [libSQL](https://github.com/libsql/libsql) to provide a SQLite-compatible database:

```ts
import { useDatabase } from "@gensx/storage";

const QueryData = gensx.Component(
  "QueryData",
  async ({ query }: QueryDataInput) => {
    // Locally, this creates a SQLite database in .gensx/databases
    const db = await useDatabase("my-database");
    const result = await db.execute(query);
    return result.rows;
  },
);
```

Database files are stored in the `.gensx/databases` directory as SQLite files that you can inspect with any SQLite client.

### Vector search

For vector search operations with `useSearch`, your local environment connects to the cloud service:

```ts
import { useSearch } from "@gensx/storage";

const SearchDocs = gensx.Component(
  "SearchDocs",
  async ({ query }: SearchDocsInput) => {
    // Uses cloud vector search even in local development
    const namespace = await useSearch("documents");
    const results = await namespace.query({
      text: query,
      topK: 5,
    });
    return results;
  },
);
```
